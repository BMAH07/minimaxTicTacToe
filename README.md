Executable Jar file: http://goo.gl/4mXUq9

This is a human vs computer version of tic tac toe written in Java. 
All the source files are contained in this repo as well as a Jar file that can be run on its own 
(with the Java resource loader: Jar resource loader).

All source files contain documentation in their headers and via in-line comments.
Code is capped below 80 characters wide; commentary extends to 120 characters.
One primary difference between this implementation and others is that an effort has been made to represent the game state in a single integer.
